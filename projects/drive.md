I wanted to brush up on some modelling skills and thought a car was a nice challenge. I wanted to combine it with my volumetric lighting system built for URP and the result is this nice small scene. Writing the car controller was a lot of fun and a good way to get familiar with 3D physics. All textures, vfx and models are made by me. 

Below is the highpoly model of the car.
