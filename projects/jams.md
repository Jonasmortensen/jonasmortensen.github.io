Every once in a while I join Game Jams with one of my game dev buddies [Jurganson](https://jurganson.github.io/). 
We always try to make something that feels complete and looks pretty (as pretty as one can expect from a jam project). 

The games can be played on [itch.io](https://jonasmortensen.itch.io/).

#### Flip & Fit

Made in 48 hours at Nordic Game Jam 2024. I was in charge of all art and music as well as writing the player controller.

Inspired by a famous japanese game show the aim of the game is to stack tetris blocks to make them fit the cutout in an approaching wall.

#### Cranberry Daddy

This little game was made as a submission to Nordic Game Jam 2023.

In the game you play as *Cranberry Daddy* in charge of delivering delicous cranberry juice to your hard working mates at the beach.

#### Lawn and Order

This was made for the Lost Relic Game Jam.

The game is pretty hard and sees you as a kid trying to engineer your way out of mowing the lawn using oscccilation modules and a wires. 

I worked on art, music and gameplay. 

#### Oink

This game was made in 48 hours as an entry to the Brackeys 2022.1 game jam. 

It's a puzzle game where you uncover the secrets of an old mansion with strange pictures on the walls.

I did everything on the art and VFX side.
