While at Unity I was responsible for delivering this collection of scenes. I did technical art work on each of the scenes as well as art direction and general concept development. The main challenge was performance optimizing the scenes to make them run on the target hardware which includes iPhone 6s, Nintendo Switch and Meta Quest 2.
