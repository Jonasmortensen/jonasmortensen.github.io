## I'm Jonas
# I'm passionate about beautiful video games and VFX.

I work as a Technical Artist at Unity where I provide feedback on artist workflows and tools as well as create material for learning and marketing. I work mainly with the Universal Render Pipeline trying my best to make it the obvious first pick for any 3D game with a wide platform reach.

I'm pretty good at:

- Real Time Graphics
- Unity, Blender, Houdini, Substance Suite
- Writing C#
- Writing HLSL
- Modelling
- Texturing
- Playing Music
